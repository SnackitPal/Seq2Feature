# Future Enhancements for Seq2Feature Web App

This document outlines potential improvements and new features for the Seq2Feature web application, categorized for easier development planning.

## ðŸš€ Web App Building & Enhancements

### 1. Robust Error Handling and Edge Cases

*   **Goal:** Improve the application's resilience and user feedback when encountering unexpected data or operations.
*   **Details:**
    *   Implement more specific error messages for invalid FASTA formats (e.g., non-standard characters, incorrect headers).
    *   Handle cases of empty sequences or sequences with only unknown characters.
    *   Validate the `labels.csv` file format (e.g., ensure 'id' and 'label' columns exist, IDs match FASTA entries).
    *   Add checks for features with zero variance before PCA or model training, as these can cause errors in some algorithms.
    *   Provide clear warnings or prevent operations if data is unsuitable (e.g., trying to calculate amino acid composition for DNA).

### 2. User Experience (UX) Enhancements

*   **Goal:** Make the application more intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Clearer Feedback:** Provide more specific success/error messages beyond simple "File uploaded successfully!".
    *   **Detailed Progress Indicators:** For long-running tasks (feature extraction, SHAP calculation), implement more granular progress bars or status updates.
    *   **Input Validation:** Add client-side validation for numerical inputs (e.g., k-mer length) to prevent invalid entries.
    *   **Layout and Styling:** Explore custom CSS or Streamlit theming options to create a more branded or polished look.
    *   **Interactive Sequence Preview:** Instead of just text, perhaps a scrollable, syntax-highlighted sequence viewer.

### 3. Performance Optimization

*   **Goal:** Improve the speed and efficiency of the application, especially for larger datasets.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Streamlit Caching:** Utilize `@st.cache_data` and `@st.cache_resource` decorators more extensively for expensive computations (e.g., feature extraction results, model training if parameters are fixed).
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** For extremely long tasks, consider offloading computations to background workers or separate processes to keep the UI responsive.
    *   **Batch Processing:** Implement options for processing very large FASTA files in smaller batches.

### 4. Scalability

*   **Goal:** Prepare the application for handling more users or larger computational demands.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Cloud Deployment Strategy:** Beyond basic Streamlit Cloud, consider deployment on platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure for more control over resources and scaling.
    *   **Backend API Separation:** For complex applications, separating the Streamlit frontend from a dedicated backend API (e.g., using FastAPI or Flask) can improve modularity, performance, and scalability.

### 5. More Machine Learning Models and Options

*   **Goal:** Expand the analytical capabilities of the ML integration.
*   **Details:**
    *   **Additional Classification Algorithms:** Integrate other popular models like Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Machines (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM), or Neural Networks.
    *   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Add options for users to tune model hyperparameters (e.g., number of estimators for RandomForest, C for SVM).
    *   **Cross-Validation:** Implement k-fold cross-validation for more robust model evaluation.
    *   **Regression Models:** If applicable to future use cases, add support for predicting continuous target variables.
    *   **Clustering Algorithms:** Integrate unsupervised learning methods (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN) for sequence clustering.
