# Project Progress: Seq2Feature

This file tracks the development progress of the Seq2Feature project.

## Phase 1: Backend Core (Completed)

- [x] **Project Setup:**
    - [x] Initialized project structure.
    - [x] Set up a virtual environment.
    - [x] Installed all necessary dependencies.
- [x] **Core Functionality:**
    - [x] Implemented `read_fasta()` for reading sequence files.
    - [x] Implemented `detect_sequence_type()` to classify sequences.
- [x] **Feature Extraction:**
    - [x] Implemented `get_amino_acid_composition()`.
    - [x] Implemented `get_dipeptide_composition()`.
    - [x] Implemented `get_kmer_frequencies()`.
    - [x] Implemented `get_physicochemical_features()`.
- [x] **Integration & Testing:**
    - [x] Implemented `extract_features()` to combine all feature extraction functions.
    - [x] Added comprehensive unit tests for all functions.
    - [x] All tests are passing.
- [x] **Command-Line Interface:**
    - [x] Created a CLI to run the feature extraction from the terminal.
    - [x] Tested the CLI and confirmed it generates the correct output.

## Phase 2: Frontend (Completed)

- [x] **Streamlit App Setup:**
    - [x] Created the basic Streamlit app layout.
    - [x] Added file upload functionality.
- [x] **UI Components:**
    - [x] Added a sequence preview table.
    - [x] Added a dropdown menu for feature selection.
    - [x] Added a "Run" button to trigger feature extraction.
- [x] **Results Display:**
    - [x] Displayed the extracted features in a data table.
- [x] **Export Functionality:**
    - [x] Added an export button to download the results as a CSV file.

## Phase 3: Visualization Add-ons (Completed)

- [x] **Summary Charts:**
    - [x] Added a histogram of feature distributions.
    - [x] Added a correlation matrix heatmap.
- [x] **Dimensionality Reduction:**
    - [x] Added a PCA projection plot of the feature space.

## Phase 4: Machine Learning Integration (Completed)

- [x] **User Interface:**
    - [x] Added UI for uploading labels.
- [x] **Model Training:**
    - [x] Added functionality to auto-train simple models (RandomForest, SVM).
    - [x] Implemented a train/test split.
- [x] **Results & Interpretation:**
    - [x] Displayed model accuracy and a confusion matrix.
    - [x] Showed top contributing features (SHAP values).
- [x] **Export:**
    - [x] Added a button to download the trained model and a report.
